Hypothesis:
  - the in valve does not close quick enough when switching fast from inspiration to expiration (higher effort)
  - try to add the values negative In values lower than sensor error (-0.3) to the Out pressure
  - 4.27 is a max value and can be an error; not sure if it can be added or not.
Result:
  - minor, if any.
